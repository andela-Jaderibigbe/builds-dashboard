## Getting started
From the root of the application

```sh
 $ cd ./code/build-dashboard
 ```
Depending on your favorite, you can use `yarn` scripts or `npm` scripts defined below

## Yarn Scripts

* `yarn` - install dependencies
* `yarn start` - run development server (I have wired up the start command to run lint, then run tests serving the bundle file over localhost)
* `yarn test` - to run all unit tests

## NPM Scripts
Similar to Yarn, really...

* `npm install` - install dependencies
* `npm start` - run development server (I have wired up the start command to run lint, then run tests serving the bundle file over localhost)
* `npm run test` - run unit tests


## Viewing App
Once the project is succesfully compiled, After running either all of yarn npm scripts above,  you will see something like
```sh
Project is running at http://localhost:3000/
webpack output is served from /
Content not from webpack is served from ./app
404s will fallback to /index.html
```

App can be viewed on `http://localhost:3000/`
